### Definitely happening someday ###

  * Run arbitrary commands on all distribution hosts.

  * Add more VCS backends.

  * Rewrite the very rudimentary config file parsing.

  * Add some sort of testing functionality (unittest or doctest, etc...)

  * Only call commit/merge once when removing multiple files.

### Would be nice to have ###
