## Figit is a low maintenance tool for managing system configuration file content and meta-data across multiple hosts. ##

With just a small set of commands Figit allows you to:
  * Download files from any ssh enabled server directly into a version control repository such as cvs, svn, git, bzr, hg, etc...
  * Track file meta data such as ownership and mode settings on a per-file basis.
  * Apply your file content and meta data changes to all ssh enabled hosts in a predefined distribution list.
  * Roll back the changes to all hosts in the distribution list to any state.

**System requirements for the Figit host:** see [Installation](Installation.md) Requirements

**System requirements for the distribution hosts:** SSH, sudo.

_That's it!_
